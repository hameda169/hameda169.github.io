Embrace Reality and Deal with It



There is nothing more important than understanding how reality works and

how to deal with it. The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the

diï¬€erence. I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in

which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I

get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of

problem in the future. Collec ng these gems con nually improves my

decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in

which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.

All sorts of emo ons come to me while I am playing and those emo ons

can either help me or hurt me. If I can reconcile my emo ons with my logic

and only act when they are aligned, I make be er decisions.

Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and

then building them out is incredibly exci ng to me. Stretching for big goals

puts me in the posi on of failing and needing to learn and come up with new

inven ons in order to move forward. I ï¬nd it exhilara ng being caught up in

the feedback loop of rapid learningâ€”just as a surfer loves riding a wave,

even though it some mes leads to crashes. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m s ll

scared of the crashes and I s ll ï¬nd them painful. But I keep that pain in

perspec ve, knowing that I will get through these setbacks and that most of

my learning will come from reï¬‚ec ng on them.14 Just as long-distance

runners push through pain to experience the pleasure of â€œrunnerâ€™s high,â€ I

have largely go en past the pain of my mistake making and instead enjoy the

pleasure that comes with learning from it. I believe that with prac ce you

can change your habits and experience the same â€œmistake learnerâ€™s high.â€

1.1 Be a hyperrealist.Understanding, accep ng, and working with reality is both prac cal and

beau ful. I have become so much of a hyperrealist that Iâ€™ve learned to

appreciate the beauty of all reali es, even harsh ones, and have come to

despise imprac cal idealism.

Donâ€™t get me wrong: I believe in making dreams happen. To me, thereâ€™s

nothing be er in life than doing that. The pursuit of dreams is what gives life

its ï¬‚avor. My point is that people who create great things arenâ€™t idle

dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealis c will help

you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them. I have found the

following to be almost always true:

a. Dreams + Reality + Determina on = A Successful Life. People who achieve success

and drive progress deeply understand the cause-eï¬€ect rela onships that

govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want. The

converse is also true: Idealists who are not well grounded in reality create

problems, not progress.

What does a successful life look like? We all have our own deep-seated

needs, so we each have to decide for ourselves what success is. I donâ€™t care

whether you want to be a master of the universe, a couch potato, or

anything elseâ€”I really donâ€™t. Some people want to change the world and

others want to operate in simple harmony with it and savor life. Neither is

be er. Each of us needs to decide what we value most and choose the paths

we take to achieve it.

Take a moment to reï¬‚ect on where you are on the following scale, which

illustrates an overly simpliï¬ed choice you should think about. Where would

you put yourself on it?

The ques on isnâ€™t just how much of each to go a er, but how hard to

work to get as much as possible. I wanted crazy amounts of each, was

thrilled to work hard to get as much of them as possible, and found that they

could largely be one and the same and mutually reinforcing. Over me Ilearned that ge ng more out of life wasnâ€™t just a ma er of working harder

at it. It was much more a ma er of working eï¬€ec vely, because working

eï¬€ec vely could increase my capacity by hundreds of mes. I donâ€™t care

what you want or how hard you want to work for it. Thatâ€™s for you to decide.

Iâ€™m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of

each hour of me and each unit of eï¬€ort.

Most importantly, Iâ€™ve learned that there is no escaping the fact that:

1.2

Truthâ€”or, more precisely, an

understanding of realityâ€”is the

founda on for any good outcome.

accurate

essen al

Most people ï¬ght seeing whatâ€™s true when itâ€™s not what they want it to be.

Thatâ€™s bad, because it is more important to understand and deal with the

bad stuï¬€ since the good stuï¬€ will take care of itself.

Do you agree with that? If not, you are unlikely to beneï¬t from what

follows. If you do agree, letâ€™s build on it.

1.3 Be radically open-minded and radically transparent.

None of us is born knowing what is true; we either have to discover whatâ€™s

true for ourselves or believe and follow others. The key is to know which

path will yield be er results.15 I believe that:

a. Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and

eï¬€ec ve change. Learning is the product of a con nuous real- me feedback

loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our

understanding of reality as a result. Being radically open-minded enhances

the eï¬ƒciency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing,

and why, so clear to yourself and others that there canâ€™t be any

misunderstandings. The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to

deceive yourselfâ€”and the more likely it is that others will give you honest

feedback. If they are â€œbelievableâ€ people (and itâ€™s very important to know

who is â€œbelievableâ€16), you will learn a lot from them.Being radically transparent and radically open-minded accelerates this

learning process. It can also be diï¬ƒcult because being radically transparent

rather than more guarded exposes one to cri cism. Itâ€™s natural to fear that.

Yet if you donâ€™t put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you

wonâ€™t learn.

b. Donâ€™t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way. You must be willing to

do things in the unique ways you think are bestâ€”and to open-mindedly

reï¬‚ect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.

Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public:

While itâ€™s ini ally awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you

will be with it. This has been true for me. For example, I s ll ins nc vely ï¬nd

being as radically transparent in the ways that I am in this book

uncomfortable because I am exposing personal material to the public that

will a ract a en on and cri cism. Yet I am doing it because Iâ€™ve learned that

itâ€™s best, and I wouldnâ€™t feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the

way. In other words, I have experienced the posi ve eï¬€ects of radical

transparency for so long that itâ€™s now uncomfortable for me not to be that

way.

Besides giving me the freedom to be me, it has allowed me to understand

others and for them to understand me, which is much more eï¬ƒcient and

much more enjoyable than not having this understanding. Imagine how

many fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more eï¬ƒcient

the world would beâ€”and how much closer we all would be to knowing

whatâ€™s trueâ€”if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly.

Iâ€™m not talking about everyoneâ€™s very personal inner secrets; Iâ€™m talking

about peopleâ€™s opinions of each other and of how the world works. As youâ€™ll

see, Iâ€™ve learned ï¬rsthand how powerful this kind of radical truth and

transparency is in improving my decision making and my rela onships. So

whenever Iâ€™m faced with the choice, my ins nct is to be transparent. I

prac ce it as a discipline and I recommend you do the same.

c. Embracing radical truth and radical transparency will bring more meaningful work and

more meaningful rela onships. My experience, based on watching thousands of

people try this approach, is that with prac ce the vast majority ï¬nd it sorewarding and pleasurable that they have a hard me opera ng any other

way.

This takes prac ce and changing oneâ€™s habits. I have found that it typically

takes about eighteen months, which is how long it takes to change most

habits.

1.4 Look to nature to learn how reality works.

All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didnâ€™t create these

laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own

evolu on and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to ï¬‚y or to send cell

phone signals around the world came from understanding and applying the

exis ng rules of realityâ€”the physical laws or principles that govern the

natural world.

While I spend most of my me studying the reali es that aï¬€ect me most

directlyâ€”those that drive economies, the markets, and the people I deal

withâ€”I also spend me in nature and canâ€™t help reï¬‚ec ng on how it works

by observing, reading, and speaking with some of the greatest specialists on

the subject. Iâ€™ve found it both interes ng and valuable to observe which laws

we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which diï¬€eren ate

us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life.

First of all, I see how cool it is that the brainâ€™s evolu on gave us the ability

to reï¬‚ect on how reality works in this way. Manâ€™s most dis nc ve quality is

our singular ability to look down on reality from a higher perspec ve and

synthesize an understanding of it. While other species operate by following

their ins ncts, man alone can go above himself and look at himself within his

circumstances and within me (including before and a er his existence). For

example, we can ponder the ways that natureâ€™s ï¬‚ying machines, swimming

machines, and billions of other machines, from the microscopic to the

cosmic, interact with one another to make up a working whole that evolves

through me. This is because the evolu on of the brain gave man a much

more developed neocortex, which gives us the power to think abstractly and

logically.

While our higher-level thinking makes us unique among species, it can

also make us uniquely confused. Other species have much simpler and morestraigh orward lives, without any of manâ€™s wrestling with whatâ€™s good and

whatâ€™s bad. In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their

emo ons and their ins ncts (which come from the animal parts of their

brains) with their reasoning (which comes from parts of the brain more

developed in humans). This struggle causes people to confuse what they

want to be true with what actually is true. Letâ€™s look at this dilemma to try to

understand how reality works.

When trying to understand anythingâ€”economies, markets, the weather,

whateverâ€”one can approach the subject with two perspec ves:

1. Top down: By trying to ï¬nd the one code/law that drives them all. For

example, in the case of markets, one could study universal laws like

supply and demand that aï¬€ect all economies and markets. In the case

of species, one could focus on learning how the gene c code (DNA)

works for all species.

2. Bo om up: By studying each speciï¬c case and the codes/laws that are

true for them, for example, the codes or laws par cular to the market

for wheat or the DNA sequences that make ducks diï¬€erent from other

species.

Seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves

and the laws of reality within the context of overarching universal laws.

Thatâ€™s not to say itâ€™s not worth having a bo om-up perspec ve. In fact, to

understand the world accurately you need both. By taking a bo om-up

perspec ve that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up

with our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. When they line

up, weâ€™re good.

By looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what

we call human nature is really animal nature. Thatâ€™s because the human

brain is programmed with millions of years of gene c learning that we share

with other species. Because we share common roots and common laws, we

and other animals have similar a ributes and constraints. For example, the

male/female sexual reproduc on process, using two eyes to provide depth

percep on, and many other systems are shared by many species in the

animal kingdom. Similarly, our brains have some â€œanimalâ€ parts that are

much older in evolu onary terms than humanity is. These laws that we havein common are the most overarching ones. They wouldnâ€™t be apparent to us

if we just looked at ourselves.

If you just looked at one speciesâ€”ducks, for exampleâ€”to try to

understand the universal laws, youâ€™d fail. Similarly, if you just looked at

mankind to understand the universal laws, youâ€™d fail. Man is just one of ten

million species and just one of the billions of manifesta ons of the forces

that bring together and take apart atoms through me. Yet most people are

like ants focused only on themselves and their own anthill; they believe the

universe revolves around people and donâ€™t pay a en on to the universal

laws that are true for all species.

To try to ï¬gure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing

with it, Iâ€™ve found it helpful to try to look at things from natureâ€™s perspec ve.

While mankind is very intelligent in rela on to other species, we have the

intelligence of moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We

are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all the species

and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the premise that

nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works.

a. Donâ€™t get hung up on your views of how things â€œshouldâ€ be because you will miss out on

learning how they really are. Itâ€™s important not to let our biases stand in the way

of our objec vity. To get good results, we need to be analy cal rather than

emo onal.

Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is

wrong, I assume that Iâ€™m wrong and try to ï¬gure out why what nature is

doing makes sense. That has taught me a lot. It has changed my thinking

about 1) whatâ€™s good and whatâ€™s bad, 2) what my purpose in life is, and 3)

what I should do when faced with my most important choices. To help

explain why, I will give you a simple example.

When I went to Africa a number of years ago, I saw a pack of hyenas take

down a young wildebeest. My reac on was visceral. I felt empathy for the

wildebeest and thought that what I had witnessed was horrible. But was that

because it was horrible or was it because I am biased to believe itâ€™s horrible

when it is actually wonderful? That got me thinking. Would the world be a

be er or worse place if what Iâ€™d seen hadnâ€™t occurred? That perspec ve

drove me to consider the second- and third-order consequences so that I

could see that the world would be worse. I now realize that nature op mizesfor the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad

based only on how it aï¬€ects them. What I had seen was the process of

nature at work, which is much more eï¬€ec ve at furthering the improvement

of the whole than any process man has ever invented.

Most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they

empathize with, ignoring the greater good. This tendency extends to groups:

One religion will consider its beliefs good and another religionâ€™s beliefs bad

to such an extent that their members might kill each other in the mutual

convic on that each is doing whatâ€™s right. Typically, peopleâ€™s conï¬‚ic ng

beliefs or conï¬‚ic ng interests make them unable to see things through

anotherâ€™s eyes. Thatâ€™s not good and it doesnâ€™t make sense. While I could

understand people liking something that helps them and disliking things that

hurt them, it doesnâ€™t make sense to call something good or bad in an

absolute sense based only on how it aï¬€ects individuals. To do so would

presume that what the individual wants is more important than the good of

the whole. To me, nature seems to deï¬ne good as whatâ€™s good for the whole

and op mizes for it, which is preferable. So I have come to believe that as a

general rule:

b. To be â€œgoodâ€ something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute

to the evolu on of the whole; that is what is most rewarded. For example, if you come

up with something the world values, you almost canâ€™t help but be rewarded.

Conversely, reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that

donâ€™t work well and detract from evolu on.17

In looking at what is true for everything, I have come to believe that:

c. Evolu on is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent

and it drives everything.18 Everything from the smallest subatomic par cle to the

en re galaxy is evolving. While everything apparently dies or disappears in

me, the truth is that it all just gets reconï¬gured in evolving forms.

Remember that energy canâ€™t be destroyedâ€”it can only be reconï¬gured. So

the same stuï¬€ is con nuously falling apart and coalescing in diï¬€erent forms.

The force behind that is evolu on.

For example, the primary purpose of every living thing is to act as a vessel

for the DNA that evolves life through me. The DNA that exists within eachindividual came from an eternity ago and will con nue to live long a er its

individual carriers pass away, in increasingly evolved forms.19

As I thought about evolu on, I realized that it exists in other forms than

life and is carried out through other transmission mechanisms than DNA.

Technologies, languages, and everything else evolves. Knowledge, for

example, is like DNA in that it is passed from genera on to genera on and

evolves; its impact on people over many genera ons can be as great or

greater than that of the gene c code.

Evolu on is good because it is the process of adapta on that generally

moves things toward improvement. All things such as products,

organiza ons, and human capabili es evolve through me in a similar way. It

is simply the process by which things either adapt and improve or die. To me

this evolu onary process looks like what you see on the right:Evolu on consists of adapta ons/inven ons that provide spurts of

beneï¬ts that decline in value. That painful decline leads either to new

adapta ons and new inven ons that bring new products, organiza ons, and

human capabili es to new and higher levels of development (as shown in

the top diagram on the facing page); or decline and death, which looks like

the diagram at bo om le .

Think of any product, organiza on, or person you know and you will see

that this is true. The world is li ered with once-great things that deteriorated

and failed; only a rare few have kept reinven ng themselves to go on to new

heights of greatness. All machines eventually break down, decompose, and

have their parts recycled to create new machines. That includes us.

Some mes this makes us sad because weâ€™ve become a ached to our

machines, but if you look at it from the higher level, itâ€™s really beau ful to

observe how the machine of evolu on works.

From this perspec ve, we can see that perfec on doesnâ€™t exist; it is a goal

that fuels a never-ending process of adapta on. If nature, or anything, were

perfect it wouldnâ€™t be evolving. Organisms, organiza ons, and individual

people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than

ge ng stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending weâ€™re perfect, it makes

sense to ï¬nd our imperfec ons and deal with them. You will either learn

valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on, be er equipped to

succeedâ€”or you wonâ€™t and you will fail.

As the saying goes:

d. Evolve or die. This evolu onary cycle is not just for people but for countries,

companies, economiesâ€”for everything. And it is naturally self-correc ng as a

whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much

supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of

business, and capacity will be reduced un l the supply falls in line with the

demand, at which me the cycle will start to move in the opposite direc on.

Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it

will make the poli cal and policy changes that are neededâ€”or they will not

survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are

con nuous and play out in logical waysâ€”and they tend to be self-reinforcing.The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly. If youâ€™re constantly learning

and improving, your evolu onary process will look like the one thatâ€™s

ascending. Do it poorly and it will look like what you see on the le , or

worse.

I believe that:

1.5 Evolving is lifeâ€™s greatest accomplishment and its

greatest reward.

It is ins nctually that way, which is why most of us feel the pull of itâ€”in

other words, we ins nc vely want to get be er at things and have created

and evolved technology to help us. History has shown that all species will

either go ex nct or evolve into other species, though with our limited me

window that is hard for us to see. But we do know that what we call

mankind was simply the result of DNA evolving into a new form about two

hundred thousand years ago, and we know that mankind will certainly

either go ex nct or evolve into a higher state. I personally believe there is a

good chance man will begin to evolve at an accelera ng pace with the help

of man-made technologies that can analyze vast amounts of data and

â€œthinkâ€ faster and be er than we can. I wonder how many centuries it will

take for us to evolve into a higher-level species that will be much closer to

omniscience than we are nowâ€”if we donâ€™t destroy ourselves ï¬rst.

One of the great marvels of nature is how the whole system, which is full

of individual organisms ac ng in their own self-interest and without

understanding or guiding whatâ€™s going on, can create a beau fully opera ng

and evolving whole. While Iâ€™m not an expert at this, it seems that itâ€™s

because evolu on has produced a) incen ves and interac ons that lead to

individuals pursuing their own interests and resul ng in the advancement of

the whole, b) the natural selec on process, and c) rapid experimenta on

and adapta on.

a. The individualâ€™s incen ves must be aligned with the groupâ€™s goals.To give you a quick

example of nature crea ng incen ves that lead to individuals pursuing their

own interests that result in the advancement of the whole, look at sex and

natural selec on. Nature gave us one hell of an incen ve to have sex in theform of the great pleasure it provides, even though the purpose of having

sex is to contribute to the advancement of the DNA. That way, we

individually get what we want while contribu ng to the evolu on of the

whole.

b. Reality is op mizing for the wholeâ€”not for you. Contribute to the whole and you

will likely be rewarded. Natural selec on leads to be er quali es being

retained and passed along (e.g., in be er genes, be er abili es to nurture

others, be er products, etc.). The result is a constant cycle of improvement

for the whole.

c. Adapta on through rapid trial and error is invaluable. Natural selec onâ€™s trial-and-

error process allows improvement without anyone understanding or guiding

it. The same can apply to how we learn. There are at least three kinds of

learning that foster evolu on: memory-based learning (storing the

informa on that comes in through oneâ€™s conscious mind so that we can

recall it later); subconscious learning (the knowledge we take away from our

experiences that never enters our conscious minds, though it aï¬€ects our

decision making); and â€œlearningâ€ that occurs without thinking at all, such as

the changes in DNA that encode a speciesâ€™ adapta ons. I used to think that

memory-based, conscious learning was the most powerful, but Iâ€™ve since

come to understand that it produces less rapid progress than

experimenta on and adapta on. To give you an example of how nature

improves without thinking, just look at the struggle that mankind (with all

its thinking) has experienced in trying to outsmart viruses (which donâ€™t even

have brains). Viruses are like brilliant chess opponents. By evolving quickly

(combining diï¬€erent gene c material across diï¬€erent strains), they keep the

smartest minds in the global health community busy thinking up

countermoves to hold them oï¬€. Understanding that is especially helpful in

an era when computers can run large numbers of simula ons replica ng

the evolu onary process to help us see what works and what doesnâ€™t.

In the next chapter I will describe a process that has helped me, and I

believe can help you, evolve quickly. But ï¬rst I want to emphasize how

important your perspec ve is in trying to decide what is important to you

and what to go a er.d. Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothingâ€”and decide what you want

to be. It is a great paradox that individually we are simultaneously everything

and nothing. Through our own eyes, we are everythingâ€”e.g., when we die,

the whole world disappears. So to most people (and to other species) dying

is the worst thing possible, and it is of paramount importance that we have

the best life possible. However, when we look down on ourselves through

the eyes of nature we are of absolutely no signiï¬cance. It is a reality that

each one of us is only one of about seven billion of our species alive today

and that our species is only one of about ten million species on our planet.

Earth is just one of about 100 billion planets in our galaxy, which is just one

of about two trillion galaxies in the universe. And our life mes are only

about 1/3,000 of humanityâ€™s existence, which itself is only 1/20,000 of the

Earthâ€™s existence. In other words, we are unbelievably ny and short-lived

and no ma er what we accomplish, our impact will be insigniï¬cant. At the

same me, we ins nctually want to ma er and to evolve, and we can

ma er a ny bitâ€”and itâ€™s all those ny bits that add up to drive the

evolu on of the universe.

The ques on is how we ma er and evolve. Do we ma er to others (who

also donâ€™t ma er in the grand scope of things) or in some greater sense that

we will never actually achieve? Or does it not ma er if we ma er so we

should forget about the ques on and just enjoy our lives while they last?

e. What you will be will depend on the perspec ve you have. Where you go in life will

depend on how you see things and who and what you feel connected to

(your family, your community, your country, mankind, the whole ecosystem,

everything). You will have to decide to what extent you will put the interests

of others above your own, and which others you will choose to do so for.

Thatâ€™s because you will regularly encounter situa ons that will force you to

make such choices.

While such decisions might seem too erudite for your taste, you will make

them either consciously or subliminally, and they will be very important.

For me personally, I now ï¬nd it thrilling to embrace reality, to look down

on myself through natureâ€™s perspec ve, and to be an inï¬nitesimally small

part of the whole. My ins nctual and intellectual goal is simply to evolveand contribute to evolu on in some ny way while Iâ€™m here and while I am

what I am. At the same me, the things I love mostâ€”my work and my

rela onshipsâ€”are what mo vate me. So, I ï¬nd how reality and nature

work, including how I and everything will decompose and recompose,

beau fulâ€”though emo onally I ï¬nd the separa on from those I care about

diï¬ƒcult to appreciate.

1.6 Understand natureâ€™s prac cal lessons.

I have found understanding how nature and evolu on work helpful in a

number of ways. Most importantly, it has helped me deal with my reali es

more eï¬€ec vely and make diï¬ƒcult choices. When I began to look at reality

through the perspec ve of ï¬guring out how it really works, instead of

thinking things should be diï¬€erent, I realized that most everything that at

ï¬rst seemed â€œbadâ€ to meâ€”like rainy days, weaknesses, and even deathâ€”

was because I held preconceived no ons of what I personally wanted. With

me, I learned that my ini al reac on was because I hadnâ€™t put whatever I

was reac ng to in the context of the fact that reality is built to op mize for

the whole rather than for me.

a. Maximize your evolu on. Earlier, I men oned that the unique abili es of

thinking logically, abstractly, and from a higher level are carried out in

structures located in the neocortex. These parts of the brain are more

developed in humans and allow us to reï¬‚ect on ourselves and direct our

own evolu on. Because we are capable of conscious, memory-based

learning, we can evolve further and faster than any other species, changing

not just across genera ons but within our own life mes.

This constant drive toward learning and improvement makes ge ng

be er innately enjoyable and ge ng be er fast exhilara ng. Though most

people think that they are striving to get the things (toys, bigger houses,

money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, for most people those

things donâ€™t supply anywhere near the long-term sa sfac on that ge ng

be er at something does.20 Once we get the things we are striving for, we

rarely remain sa sï¬ed with them. The things are just the bait. Chasing a er

them forces us to evolve, and it is the evolu on and not the rewardsthemselves that ma ers to us and to those around us. This means that for

most people success is struggling and evolving as eï¬€ec vely as possible, i.e.,

learning rapidly about oneself and oneâ€™s environment, and then changing to

improve.

It is natural that it should be this way because of the law of diminishing

returns.21 Consider what acquiring money is like. People who earn so much

that they derive li le or no marginal gains from it will experience nega ve

consequences, as with any other form of excess, like glu ony. If they are

intellectually healthy, they will begin seeking something new or seeking new

depths in something oldâ€”and they will get stronger in the process. As

Freud put it, â€œLove and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.â€

The work doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe itâ€™s

generally be er if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term challenge that

leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that

the need to have meaningful work is connected to manâ€™s innate desire to

improve. And rela onships are the natural connec ons to others that make

us relevant to each other and to society more broadly.

b. Remember â€œno pain, no gain.â€ Realizing that we innately want to evolveâ€”and

that the other stuï¬€ we are going a er, while nice, wonâ€™t sustain our

happinessâ€”has helped me focus on my goals of evolving and contribu ng

to evolu on in my own inï¬nitely small way. While we donâ€™t like pain,

everything that nature made has a purpose, so nature gave us pain for a

purpose. So what is its purpose? It alerts us and helps direct us.

c. It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push oneâ€™s

limits, which is painful. As Carl Jung put it, â€œMan needs diï¬ƒcul es. They are

necessary for health.â€ Yet most people ins nctually avoid pain. This is true

whether we are talking about building the body (e.g., weight li ing) or the

mind (e.g., frustra on, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame)â€”and

especially true when people confront the harsh reality of their own

imperfec ons.

1.7 Pain + Reï¬‚ec on = Progress.There is no avoiding pain, especially if youâ€™re going a er ambi ous goals.

Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel that kind of pain if you approach it

correctly, because it is a signal that you need to ï¬nd solu ons so you can

progress. If you can develop a reï¬‚exive reac on to psychic pain that causes

you to reï¬‚ect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid

learning/evolving.22 A er seeing how much more eï¬€ec ve it is to face the

painful reali es that are caused by your problems, mistakes, and

weaknesses, I believe you wonâ€™t want to operate any other way. Itâ€™s just a

ma er of ge ng in the habit of doing it.

Most people have a tough me reï¬‚ec ng when they are in pain and they

pay a en on to other things when the pain passes, so they miss out on the

reï¬‚ec ons that provide the lessons. If you can reï¬‚ect well while youâ€™re in

pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to

reï¬‚ect a er it passes, thatâ€™s valuable too. (I created a Pain Bu on app to

help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.)

The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If youâ€™re not failing,

youâ€™re not pushing your limits, and if youâ€™re not pushing your limits, youâ€™re

not maximizing your poten al. Though this process of pushing your limits,

of some mes failing and some mes breaking throughâ€”and deriving

beneï¬ts from both your failures and your successesâ€”is not for everyone, if

it is for you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addic ve. Life will

inevitably bring you such moments, and itâ€™ll be up to you to decide whether

you want to go back for more.

If you choose to push through this o en painful process of personal

evolu on, you will naturally â€œascendâ€ to higher and higher levels. As you

climb above the blizzard of things that surrounds you, you will realize that

they seem bigger than they really are when you are seeing them up close;

that most things in life are just â€œanother one of those.â€ The higher you

ascend, the more eï¬€ec ve you become at working with reality to shape

outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex

becomes simple.

a. Go to the pain rather than avoid it. If you donâ€™t let up on yourself and instead

become comfortable always opera ng with some level of pain, you will

evolve at a faster pace. Thatâ€™s just the way it is.Every me you confront something painful, you are at a poten ally

important juncture in your lifeâ€”you have the opportunity to choose healthy

and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion. The irony is that if

you choose the healthy route, the pain will soon turn into pleasure. The

pain is the signal! Like switching from not exercising to exercising,

developing the habit of embracing the pain and learning from it will â€œget

you to the other side.â€

By â€œge ng to the other side,â€ I mean that you will become hooked on:

â€¢ Iden fying, accep ng, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses,

â€¢ Preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than

keep their nega ve thoughts about you to themselves, and

â€¢ Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are

weak.

b. Embrace tough love. In my own life, what I want to give to people, most

importantly to people I love, is the power to deal with reality to get what

they want. In pursuit of my goal to give them strength, I will o en deny

them what they â€œwantâ€ because that will give them the opportunity to

struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on

their own. This can be diï¬ƒcult for people emo onally, even if they

understand intellectually that having diï¬ƒcul es is the exercise they need to

grow strong and that just giving them what they want will weaken them and

ul mately lead to them needing more help.23

Of course most people would prefer not to have weaknesses. Our

upbringings and our experiences in the world have condi oned us to be

embarrassed by our weaknesses and hide them. But people are happiest

when they can be themselves. If you can be open with your weaknesses it

will make you freer and will help you deal with them be er. I urge you to

not be embarrassed about your problems, recognizing that everyone has

them. Bringing them to the surface will help you break your bad habits and

develop good ones, and you will acquire real strengths and jus ï¬able

op mism.

This evolu onary process of produc ve adapta on and ascentâ€”the

process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing more and more ambi ous goals

â€”does not just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It isequally relevant when dealing with setbacks, which are inevitable. At some

point in your life you will crash in a big way. You might fail at your job or with

your family, lose a loved one, suï¬€er a serious accident or illness, or discover

the life you imagined is out of reach forever. There are a whole host of ways

that something will get you. At such mes, you will be in pain and might

think that you donâ€™t have the strength to go on. You almost always do,

however; your ul mate success will depend on you realizing that fact, even

though it might not seem that way at the moment.

This is why many people who have endured setbacks that seemed

devasta ng at the me ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they

originally were a er they successfully adapted to them. The quality of your

life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments. The

faster one appropriately adapts, the be er.24 No ma er what you want out

of life, your ability to adapt and move quickly and eï¬ƒciently through the

process of personal evolu on will determine your success and your

happiness. If you do it well, you can change your psychological reac on to it

so that what was painful can become something you crave.

1.8 Weigh second- and third-order consequences.

By recognizing the higher-level consequences nature op mizes for, Iâ€™ve

come to see that people who overweigh the ï¬rst-order consequences of

their decisions and ignore the eï¬€ects of second- and subsequent-order

consequences rarely reach their goals. This is because ï¬rst-order

consequences o en have opposite desirabili es from second-order

consequences, resul ng in big mistakes in decision making. For example,

the ï¬rst-order consequences of exercise (pain and me spent) are

commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences

(be er health and more a rac ve appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food

that tastes good is o en bad for you and vice versa.

Quite o en the ï¬rst-order consequences are the tempta ons that cost

us what we really want, and some mes they are the barriers that stand in

our way. Itâ€™s almost as though nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices

that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their

decisions on the basis of the ï¬rst-order consequences alone.By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the

tempta ons and get over the pains that drive them away from what they

really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.

1.9 Own your outcomes.

For the most part, life gives you so many decisions to make and so many

opportuni es to recover from your mistakes that, if you handle them well,

you can have a terriï¬c life. Of course, some mes there are major inï¬‚uences

on the quality of our lives that come from things beyond our controlâ€”the

circumstances we are born into, accidents and illnesses, and so forthâ€”but

for the most part even the worst circumstances can be made be er with

the right approach. For example, a friend of mine dove into a swimming

pool, hit his head, and became a quadriplegic. But he approached his

situa on well and became as happy as anybody else, because there are

many paths to happiness.

My point is simply this: Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will

be more likely to succeed and ï¬nd happiness if you take responsibility for

making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being

beyond your control. Psychologists call this having an â€œinternal locus of

control,â€ and studies consistently show that people who have it outperform

those who donâ€™t.

So donâ€™t worry about whether you like your situa on or not. Life doesnâ€™t

give a damn about what you like. Itâ€™s up to you to connect what you want

with what you need to do to get it and then ï¬nd the courage to carry it

through. In the next chapter I will show you the 5-Step Process that helped

me learn about reality and evolve.

1.10 Look at the machine from the higher level.

Our uniquely human ability to look down from a higher level doesnâ€™t apply

just to understanding reality and the cause-eï¬€ect rela onships underlying

it; it also applies to looking down on yourself and those around you. I call

this ability to rise above your own and othersâ€™ circumstances and objec velylook down on them â€œhigher-level thinking.â€ Higher-level thinking gives you

the ability to study and inï¬‚uence the cause-eï¬€ect rela onships at play in

your life and use them to get the outcomes you want.

a. Think of yourself as a machine opera ng within a machine and know that you have the

ability to alter your machines to produce be er outcomes. You have your goals. I call

the way you will operate to achieve your goals your machine. It consists of a

design (the things that have to get done) and the people (who will do the

things that need ge ng done). Those people include you and those who

help you. For example, imagine that your goal is a military one: to take a hill

from an enemy. Your design for your â€œmachineâ€ might include two scouts,

two snipers, four infantrymen, and so on. While the right design is essen al,

it is only half the ba le. It is equally important to put the right people in

each of those posi ons. They need diï¬€erent quali es to do their jobs wellâ€”

the scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be good marksmenâ€”so

that the machine will produce the outcomes you seek.

b. By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify your

machine. This evalua on and improvement process exactly mirrors the

evolu onary process I described earlier. It means looking at how to improve

or change the design or people to achieve your goals. Schema cally, the

process is a feedback loop, as shown in the diagram on the opposite page.c. Dis nguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your

machine. One of the hardest things for people to do is to objec vely look

down on themselves within their circumstances (i.e., their machine) so that

they can act as the machineâ€™s designer and manager. Most people remain

stuck in the perspec ve of being a worker within the machine. If you can

recognize the diï¬€erences between those roles and that it is much more

important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good

worker in it, you will be on the right path. To be successful, the

â€œdesigner/manager youâ€ has to be objec ve about what the â€œworker youâ€ is

really like, not believing in him more than he deserves, or pu ng him in

jobs he shouldnâ€™t be in. Instead of having this strategic perspec ve, most

people operate emo onally and in the moment; their lives are a series of

undirected emo onal experiences, going from one thing to the next. If you

want to look back on your life and feel youâ€™ve achieved what you wanted to,

you canâ€™t operate that way.

d. The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objec vely,

which leads them to bump into their own and othersâ€™ weaknesses again and again. People

who do this fail because they are stubbornly stuck in their own heads. If

they could just get around this, they could live up to their poten al.

This is why higher-level thinking is essen al for success.

e. Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objec vely and

manage those things to shape change. They can take in the perspec ves of others

instead of being trapped in their own heads with their own biases. They are

able to look objec vely at what they are likeâ€”their strengths and

weaknessesâ€”and what others are like to put the right people in the right

roles to achieve their goals. Once you understand how to do this youâ€™ll see

that thereâ€™s virtually nothing you canâ€™t accomplish. You will just have to

learn how to face your reali es and use the full range of resources at your

disposal. For example, if you as the designer/manager discover that you as

the worker canâ€™t do something well, you need to ï¬re yourself as the worker

and get a good replacement, while staying in the role of designer/manager

of your own life. You shouldnâ€™t be upset if you ï¬nd out that youâ€™re bad atsomethingâ€”you should be happy that you found out, because knowing that

and dealing with it will improve your chances of ge ng what you want.

If you are disappointed because you canâ€™t be the best person to do

everything yourself, you are terribly naive. Nobody can do everything well.

Would you want to have Einstein on your basketball team? When he fails to

dribble and shoot well, would you think badly of him? Should he feel

humiliated? Imagine all the areas in which Einstein was incompetent, and

imagine how hard he struggled to excel even in the areas in which he was

the best in the world.

Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit

all kinds of ego-driven emo ons such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment,

anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing

struggling as something nega ve. Most of lifeâ€™s greatest opportuni es come

out of moments of struggle; itâ€™s up to you to make the most of these tests

of crea vity and character.

When encountering your weaknesses you have four choices:

1. You can deny them (which is what most people do).

2. You can accept them and work at them in order to try to convert them

into strengths (which might or might not work depending on your

ability to change).

3. You can accept your weaknesses and ï¬nd ways around them.

4. Or, you can change what you are going a er.

Which solu on you choose will be cri cally important to the direc on of

your life. The worst path you can take is the ï¬rst. Denial can only lead to

your constantly banging up against your weaknesses, having pain, and not

ge ng anywhere. The secondâ€”accep ng your weaknesses while trying to

turn them into strengthsâ€”is probably the best path if it works. But some

things you will never be good at and it takes a lot of me and eï¬€ort to

change. The best single clue as to whether you should go down this path is

whether the thing you are trying to do is consistent with your nature (i.e.,

your natural abili es). The third pathâ€”accep ng your weaknesses while

trying to ï¬nd ways around themâ€”is the easiest and typically the most viable

path, yet it is the one least followed. The fourth path, changing what youare going a er, is also a great path, though it requires ï¬‚exibility on your part

to get past your preconcep ons and enjoy the good ï¬t when you ï¬nd it.

f. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that

you should develop no ma er what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent

you from doing what you shouldnâ€™t be doing. All successful people are good at this.

g. Because it is diï¬ƒcult to see oneself objec vely, you need to rely on the input of others

and the whole body of evidence. I know that my own life has been full of

mistakes and lots of great feedback. It was only by looking down on this

body of evidence from a higher level that I was able to get around my

mistakes and go a er what I wanted. For as long as I have been prac cing

this, I s ll know I canâ€™t see myself objec vely, which is why I con nue to rely

so much on the input of others.

h. If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you

want. So I certainly donâ€™t want to dissuade you from going a er whatever

you want. At the same me, I urge you to reï¬‚ect on whether what you are

going a er is consistent with your nature. Whatever your nature is, there

are many paths that will suit you, so donâ€™t ï¬xate on just one. Should a

par cular path close, all you have to do is ï¬nd another good one consistent

with what youâ€™re like. (Youâ€™ll learn a lot about how to determine what youâ€™re

like later, in Understand That People Are Wired Very Diï¬€erently.)

But most people lack the courage to confront their own weaknesses and

make the hard choices that this process requires. Ul mately, it comes down

to the following ï¬ve decisions:

1. Donâ€™t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.

2. Donâ€™t worry about looking goodâ€”worry instead about achieving your goals.

3. Donâ€™t overweight ï¬rst-order consequences rela ve to second- and third-order ones.

4. Donâ€™t let pain stand in the way of progress.

5. Donâ€™t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

14 Iâ€™m sure Transcendental Medita on, which I have been prac cing regularly for nearly

half a century, helped provide me with the equanimity I needed to approach my challengesthis way.

15 You shouldnâ€™t assume that you are always the best person to make decisions for yourself

because o en you arenâ€™t. While it is up to us to know what we want, others may know how

to get it be er than we do because they have strengths where we have weaknesses, or

more relevant knowledge and experience. For example, itâ€™s probably be er for you to

follow your doctorâ€™s advice than your own if you have a medical condi on. Later in this

book, we will look at some of the diï¬€erent ways peopleâ€™s brains are wired and how our

understanding of our own wiring should inï¬‚uence which choices we make for ourselves

and which we should delegate to others. Knowing when not to make your own decisions is

one of the most important skills you can develop.

16 Iâ€™ll explain the concept of believability in more detail in later chapters, but to cover it

quickly: Believable par es are those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished

somethingâ€”and have great explana ons for how they did it.

17 There are many things people consider â€œgoodâ€ in the sense that they are kind or

considerate but fail to deliver whatâ€™s desired (like communismâ€™s â€œfrom each according to his

ability, to each according to his needsâ€). Nature would appear to consider them â€œbad,â€ and

Iâ€™d agree with nature.

18 Everything other than evolu on eventually disintegrates; we all are, and everything else

is, vehicles for evolu on. For example, while we see ourselves as individuals, we are

essen ally vessels for our genes that have lived millions of years and con nuously use and

shed bodies like ours.

19 I recommend Richard Dawkinsâ€™s and E. O. Wilsonâ€™s books on evolu on. If I had to pick

just one, it would be Dawkinsâ€™s River Out of Eden.

20 Of course, we are o en sa sï¬ed with the same thingsâ€”rela onships, careers, etc.â€”but

when that is the case, it is typically because we are ge ng new enjoyments from the

changing dimensions of those things.

21 The marginal beneï¬ts of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline.

22 Your unique power of reï¬‚ec venessâ€”your ability to look at yourself, the world around

you, and the rela onship between you and the worldâ€”means that you can think deeply

and weigh subtle things to come up with learning and wise choices. Asking other believable

people about the root causes of your pain in order to enhance your reï¬‚ec ons is also

typically very helpfulâ€”especially others who have opposing views but who share your

interest in ï¬nding the truth rather than being proven right. If you can reï¬‚ect deeply about

your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always ï¬nd a

be er way of dealing with them than if you donâ€™t face them head-on.

23 To be clear, I am not saying people should not be helped. I believe that people should be

helped by giving them opportuni es and the coaching they need to become strong enoughto take advantage of their opportuni es. As the saying goes, â€œGod helps those who help

themselves.â€ But this isnâ€™t easy, especially with people you care about. To be eï¬€ec ve in

helping people learn from painful experiences, you must explain the logic and caring

behind what youâ€™re doing clearly and repeatedly. As you read in â€œWhere Iâ€™m Coming From,â€

this was a large part of what compelled me to explain my principles.
